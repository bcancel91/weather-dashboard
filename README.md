# weather-dashboard
As a traveler

I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly.
  
Once user inputs a city and clicks the search button. The app will form a API request with the value of the input. The dashbord will then display current weather and cards that contain information for 5 days with things that are useful to know like:

  * City

  * Date

  * Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)

  * Temperature

  * Humidity

  * Wind speed

  * UV index
  
  After the city is input the app will store that value to the top of the list that is stored until the list reached a max of 10 cities.
  
 This App was made possible with  2 diffrent request to a single API. It runs on JavaScript, styled with CSS and Bootstrap.
